Design patter software reusable solutions to typical challenges in software development.
main objective of design pattern:-
reusablity,standardization,efficiency,flexibility.

Stage 1:
Planning and requirement analysis

Stage 2:
Defining requirements

This is accomplished using srs.
Software requirement specification

Stage 3:
Designing the software.
bring out all the knowledge of requirement, analysis and design of the software project

Stage 4:
Coding

Stage 5:
Testing

to make sure that the products are solving the needs that is addressed and gathered during the requirement stage, during the stage unit testing,integration testing
system testing.

Stage 6:
Deployment
once the software is certified and no bugs and errors ares stated and then the software is deployed.

Stage 7
maintenance

once when the client starts using the developed software the real issues will rise up for the required issue,required maintenance is needed everytime, these 
will be provided by management


USE CASE

how users will interact with system to achieve the goals,they are typically written in a structure.

the bank system that authorizes the transaction.

Preconditions:-

the bank system that authorizes the transaction.
maintenance staff
customers must have valid credentials
atm must be connected to the network
atm must have sufficient

Entity-relationship model.

it is a popular modulic techinque used to visually represents the data and is relationship
one-one
one-many
many-one

Peter chen
the er model was created to provide a simple and understandabe model for representing the structure and model of a database
diamond-relationship
ellipse-attribute
lines-atribtes to entities
double ellispse-multi valued attribute
double rectangle-entity multiplr

load must be dependent on another entity-weak entity

attribute is represented as oval

primary key-unique


blob- Binary large object-

which is a datatype which stores binary large datatype ,can be complex like images and videos
unlike other datatype that stores only letters or numbers
